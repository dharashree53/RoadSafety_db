Queries

1)	Retrieve Accident Details with Vehicle and Casualty Information:
SELECT Accidents.AccidentID, DateOccurred, TimeOccurred, StreetAddress, City, State, VehicleType, LicensePlateNumber, Age, Gender, InjuryType
FROM Accidents
JOIN Locations ON Accidents.LocationID = Locations.LocationID
LEFT JOIN Vehicles ON Accidents.AccidentID = Vehicles.AccidentID
LEFT JOIN Casualties ON Accidents.AccidentID = Casualties.AccidentID;

2)

SELECT AccidentID, OfficerName, ReportDescription
FROM Accidents
JOIN LawEnforcementReports ON Accidents.LawEnforcementReportID = LawEnforcementReports.ReportID;





2)	Find Accidents at Intersections:
SELECT AccidentID, DateOccurred, TimeOccurred, StreetAddress, City, State
FROM Accidents
JOIN Locations ON Accidents.LocationID = Locations.LocationID
WHERE StreetAddress LIKE '%intersection%';



4)
Retrieve Accidents with Multiple Vehicles and Casualties:
SELECT Accidents.AccidentID, DateOccurred, TimeOccurred, COUNT(DISTINCT Vehicles.VehicleID) AS NumVehicles, COUNT(DISTINCT Casualties.CasualtyID) AS NumCasualties
FROM Accidents
JOIN Vehicles ON Accidents.AccidentID = Vehicles.AccidentID
JOIN Casualties ON Accidents.AccidentID = Casualties.AccidentID
GROUP BY Accidents.AccidentID
HAVING NumVehicles > 1 AND NumCasualties > 1;



5)
Identify Locations with a High Rate of Hit-and-Run Incidents:
SELECT StreetAddress, City, State, COUNT(*) AS HitAndRunCount
FROM Accidents
JOIN Locations ON Accidents.LocationID = Locations.LocationID
WHERE LawEnforcementReportID IS NULL
GROUP BY StreetAddress, City, State
ORDER BY HitAndRunCount DESC;



6)
Retrieve Accidents with Unusual Patterns of Casualties:
SELECT AccidentID , CasualtyID, Age, Gender, InjuryType
FROM Casualties
WHERE (Age > 60 AND InjuryType = 'Fatal')
   OR (Age < 18 AND InjuryType = 'Minor');



7)
Calculate the Cumulative Casualty Count Over Time:
SELECT DateOccurred, SUM(CasualtyCount) OVER (ORDER BY DateOccurred) AS CumulativeCasualties
FROM (
    SELECT DateOccurred, COUNT(*) AS CasualtyCount
    FROM Accidents
    JOIN Casualties ON Accidents.AccidentID = Casualties.AccidentID
    GROUP BY DateOccurred
) AS DailyCasualties;




8)
Retrieve Accidents with a High Number of Vehicles Involved

SELECT AccidentID, COUNT(DISTINCT VehicleID) AS NumVehicles
FROM Vehicles
GROUP BY AccidentID
ORDER BY NumVehicles DESC
LIMIT 10;




9)
Identify Accidents with a High Number of Law Enforcement Reports:
SELECT AccidentID, COUNT(DISTINCT LawEnforcementReportID) AS NumReports
FROM Accidents
GROUP BY AccidentID
ORDER BY NumReports DESC
LIMIT 10;


10)
Calculate the Average Number of Vehicles Involved in Accidents by City:
SELECT City, AVG(NumVehicles) AS AvgVehiclesPerAccident
FROM (
    SELECT Accidents.AccidentID, Locations.City, COUNT(DISTINCT Vehicles.VehicleID) AS NumVehicles
    FROM Accidents
    JOIN Locations ON Accidents.LocationID = Locations.LocationID
    JOIN Vehicles ON Accidents.AccidentID = Vehicles.AccidentID
    GROUP BY Accidents.AccidentID, Locations.City
) AS VehiclesPerAccident
GROUP BY City;
